RefSet QA Shell Scripts
=======================

These linux shell scripts were written as a quick excise while learning the RefSet file QA procedure.

Running the scripts
-------------------
On a ubuntu/debian/osx command line:
```sh
cd example-refset
sh ../1-process.sh
sh ../2-post-test
```

See the output files under the 'target' directory. 'der2_Refset_SimpleFull_INT_20140131.txt' is the combined file.
